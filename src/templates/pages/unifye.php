                        Unifye is a contact information consolidation service which primarily aims to cut the time it
                        takes people to find the places you're located online.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Our service achieves this by granting each user a username and a unique tag.

                        <span class="bar">|</span> Alex <br>
                        <span class="bar">|</span> Alex#4835
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        When Alex shares his single username, the recipient may receive this selected information:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bar">|</span> Twitter: @alexjones <br>
                        <span class="bar">|</span> Instagram: @alexjones <br>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        However, the idea recognizes that maybe, Alex needs to share more personal details
                        with somebody. Alex gives his coworker:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bar">|</span> Alex#4835
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Then Alex tells his coworker to use the preferred contact place found at
                        <a>unifye.io</a>. When this is brought up, it reads:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bar">|</span> Twitter: @alexjones <br>
                        <span class="bar">|</span> Instagram: @alexjones <br>
                        <span class="bar">|</span> Email: alex@contact.me <br>
                        <span class="bar">|</span> Phone: 234-352-8285 <br>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        This is convenient as it offers his coworker a single place to find Alex's information. Thus,
                        the purpose of the service - consolidation of personal data - can occur. There's even more
                        built-in features to enhance privacy.

                        This enables the recipient to speedily receive multiple forms of contact info. In a professional
                        setting, a tag could be posted on a public face, so that recipients would have immediate access
                        to the desired contact points. Unifye is meant to simplify &amp; unify the process of sharing
                        and finding, keeping security in mind.

                        Alex can set a password on this tag, destroy it at any time, or set it to self-destruct after a
                        single use. Alex's username will remain the same to provide his public information. This way
                        Alex can destroy the tag after giving it to an untrusted stranger or keep it from being viewed
                        again if it was exchanged physically. Information is to be encrypted to AES within storage.
