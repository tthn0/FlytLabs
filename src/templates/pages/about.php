                        <br><br>

                        FlytLabs was originally conceived to advance our aspirations in regards to software,
                        communication, connectivity, and AI. Since then, these ideas have been expanded, improved and
                        added to, and our entire team is only continuing. FlytLabs's focus is creating and delivering
                        software, ideas, and mechanisms in new ways, with presentation that never falls behind the
                        current curve. We develop these creations for our users, as our main goal is only able to
                        succeed with the face of services and projects that bring a certain level of usability and
                        practicality, which our users can attribute to us.

                        <br><br>

                        These creations currently include:

                        <br><br>

                        <a href="/unifye">Unifye</a> - a contact consolidation service,
                        <a href="/xobus">Xobus AI</a> - a platform to enable a new ideology of AI learning retention
                        and usability, which powers our <a href="/importable">Importable</a> project. Importable is a
                        platform aiming to bring further ease in connecting developers with software, extensions,
                        plugins, configurations, and other types of development files. Our startup hopes to build these
                        projects in the most enticing, convenient yet extensive ways possible. They feature simple
                        usability, clean user interfaces, yet expansive functions to further the original idea. These
                        projects are created to drive FlytLabs and our users, so we're putting all of our effort
                        into creating them.
