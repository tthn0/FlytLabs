                    <p>
                        We aim to build Importable around the Xobus AI platform. Importable will be a service to enable
                        developers a more universal access to plugins, modules, configurations, and other types of files
                        found across the internet.

                    <p>
                        Importable was created to help further FlytLabs's goal and reach into the developer market,
                        creating tools which we believe in due to our roots in what we do. Importable is still
                        under development, and we'll provide updates and a more accurate timeframe for release as
                        it progresses <a href="/updates">here</a>.
