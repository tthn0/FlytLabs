                        <br><br>

                        FlytLabs is constantly growing and looking for talented individuals, looking to take on new
                        projects in which they find personal excitement in, to help us on our mission to offer the best
                        services in the world! Our applications are currently being developed largely in Python,
                        Javascript, PHP, and SQL. We're mainly looking for developers with knowledge in areas relating
                        to general data science, machine learning, cloud computing . If you are knowledgeable in any of
                        these languages or topics, you could potentially aid in our ambitions. Further, we're looking
                        for other positions as well - social media management and project management.

                        <br><br>

                        If these terms sound intriguing to you, in regards to any our projects, please contact us at
                        <a href="mailto:helpus@flytlabs.dev">helpus@flytlabs.dev</a>. Thank you for your interest!

                        <span class="heading">MONETARY COMPENSATION</span>

                        <br><br>

                        We're currently only seeking to begin to pay from our budget once we become a legal entity.
                        Additionally however, we plan on dividing 80% of each project's revenue between it's creators at
                        any time at which this begins. It should be noted that this is subject to renegotiation for the
                        monetary sustainability of the company once it becomes a legal entity, however we also seek to
                        offer stock options and even stakes for developers who continue to work with us through this
                        time.

                        <br><br>

                        While we also understand that some projects will have no immediate monetization
                        opportunities, not only do we assure you that there are some available now and in the future -
                        but if this is the case, you are able to become involved with multiple projects, and we're
                        aiming for general publicity to aid in other projects which may actually have these
                        opportunities. Further, services will only be released under conditions worthy for inclusion on
                        a resume, or portfolio, aiding you professionally. FlytLabs will also "vouch" for any of our
                        members.

                        <br><br>

                        We understand the downsides of this strategy, however regardless, we only wish for
                        developers who are participating more out of excitement, and belief in a project, rather than
                        for the immediate payment opportunities. This is because if our projects' developers are
                        strictly interested for this reason, we expect there to be a much higher chance in building them
                        to these goals which allow for monetary compensation.
